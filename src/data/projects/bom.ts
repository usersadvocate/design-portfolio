We decided to reorganize table tools and change their hierarchy. Instead of saving the graphs as a separate tab above the table, we turned them into a widget. In the table, we combined certain columns, highlighted data, and eliminated one-off elements.",

Additionally, do not rush the development of your design, especially if the design significantly alters the rules of the game.
