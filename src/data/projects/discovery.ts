        "We are faced with the fact that conducting interviews with our users has become very labor-intensive. We need to notify our users about the problem we want to discuss, write to everyone, and arrange a meeting, among other things. It is not profitable for us to pay for companies that help in hiring respondents or use other resources.",

        "The product manager of our team advised the design team to read “Continuous Discovery Habits” by Teresa Torres and consider whether we can use continuous research in our process. This approach is convenient because, once we have made an effort to create an environment for constantly hiring our users for interviews, the team no longer needs to spend resources on finding respondents and sending invitations. This becomes an automated process.",
